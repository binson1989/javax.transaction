# Java(TM) Transaction API (JTA)
Java(TM) Transaction API (JTA), one of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) APIs, enables distributed transactions to be done across multiple X/Open XA resources in a Java environment. JTA is a specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 907.

This standalone release of Java(TM) Java Transaction API (JTA), uses a [Java Platform Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/)
"automatic" module name of `java.transaction`, to match the module name used in JDK 9.  A future version will include full module metadata. Moreover `javax.transaction.xa` package is now owned by Java SE.
